            <p>Hello there! I am Karan Sah, a student of BSc(Hons) Computer Science in Herald College, Naxal. I also am a student studying BBS in Shankardev Campus.I am a language teacher and learner. I have always been interested in creating my own tech and IT company and building an IT business empire, though some may say its farfetched dream, I say its a journey worth travelling. I have been growing and learning new things every day and am taking baby steps towards my goals. So, you can say I am a tech and business enthusiast and your fellow traveller in this journey called 'life'.  </p>
