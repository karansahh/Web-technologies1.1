    About me, Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
</h1>
<h2>
   Founder of IBM's management style and corporate culture
</h2>
<h3> My brief introduction:</h3>
<p>
I, Thomas John Watson Sr. born on February 17,1874 was the chairman as well as CEO of IBM, thus an American Businessman. I pushed company's development internationally since 1914 to 1956. I created and developed IBM's management style and corporate cultures taking references form John Henry Patterson's training at NCR. On the basis of punched card tabulating machines, I converted the organization into efficient and effective selling one. I am one of the leading industrialist made by myself. Also I was richest amongst men in my era and was also one of the world's biggest and largest salesman.
