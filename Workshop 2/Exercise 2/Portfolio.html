            <p>Hello there! I am Karan Sah, a student of BSc(Hons) Computer Science in Herald College, Naxal. I also am a student studying BBS in Shankardev Campus.I am a language teacher and learner. I have always been interested in creating my own tech and IT company and building an IT business empire, though some may say its farfetched dream, I say its a journey worth travelling. I have been growing and learning new things every day and am taking baby steps towards my goals. So, you can say I am a tech and business enthusiast and your fellow traveller in this journey called 'life'.  </p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>We all have to something other than academic and work aspects of life whether it be for the purpose of recreation, just for fun or for educational purposes. Some say them hobbies, I say 'Yayy! Why not?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading creative fictional novels.</li>
                <li>Reading non fictions.</li>
                <li>Playing Guitar Solos!!</li>
                <li>Hanging out with my pets and friends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I would like to list a lot more but I didn't get enough time to do other hobbies I liked. Guess, that's what bucket lists are for. </p>
