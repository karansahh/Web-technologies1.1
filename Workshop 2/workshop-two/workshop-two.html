                    Why use alt in img?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Altough image's source and url is already mentioned in src attribute, we use alt in img tag because,
                    this attribute designates text for the provided image in case the image cannot be displayed through
                    some
                    reason. Another reason may be to make the website friendly to specially abled person so that they
                    would
                    know which image is being loaded although they couldn't see. For example, if some AI has to spell
                    out
                    the image displayed, it can't but it can spell out the text written in alt attribute so s/he would
                    know
                    about the image too.

                    This attribue is for alternate text for a definit area, if in case an image wouln't be shown. This attribute gives us the alternative information for an image if in case a user for vivid purpose wouldn't be able to see it(of tortoise pased connection, wrong src attribute, or the user uses a screen reader.)

                <dd>Let's take a picture for an example. I will deliberately write the src of img wrong so that when
                    image
                    is not shown its alternate text can be provided.</dd><br>

                <p>As you can see though the image is not loaded its text can clearly be read.</p>

                    This is used so that user may know it as screentip or tooltip. It is very much helpful in vivid
                    situations. For example: If the website is about history and you don't know which historian is
                    depicted in the picture all you have to do is hover your cursor on image and it will so you the
                    title or tooltip.

                    The explanation this code provides is with is the title attribute is moved in the img tag. The value of this attribute can be any string. Hovering the cursor over the image and the tooltip can appear after a second.

                    Let's take a above picture but loading picture this time as an example. All you have to do is hover over the image for certain period of time. The text will be shown.
